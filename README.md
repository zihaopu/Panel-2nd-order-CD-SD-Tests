All Data are stored in this file. Run HouseUSApre_server.R for preprocess the data. Run Emprirical_General_server.R for modelling and Tests. To be more specific, run 1~4 for basic dynamic panel data model. Then run 5~6 for all tests. See outcomes in Q_all. For the following modelling, one may run 7 for spatial modelling for both mean and variance structures. Then you may re-run 5~6 for new tests outcomes.
